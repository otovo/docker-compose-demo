# Docker compose demo app

This is a demo repo.

### Setting up the project locally

If you want to install the project on your client, you could do this:

- Run `pip install poetry` or follow the [poetry installation docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) to install Poetry.
- Run `poetry install`
- Run `pre-commit install`

Otherwise, you should be able to run the application
using only

```
docker compose up
```

(obviously requires docker)
